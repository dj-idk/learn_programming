> [!NOTE] Reason for user-friendliness of python: 
> Before creating Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC language—a 10-year research project to design a programming environment for beginners. ABC introduced many ideas we now consider “Pythonic”: generic operations on different types of sequences, built-in tuple and mapping types, structure by indentation, strong typing without variable declarations, and more. It’s no accident that Python is so user-friendly.

These are the main topics this document will cover:
- [[Overview of Built-In Sequences]]
1. List comprehensions [[List Comprehensions]], and the basics of generator expressions; [[Generator Expressions]]
2. Using tuples as records[[Tuples as Records]], versus using tuples as immutable lists[[Tuples as immutable Lists]];
3. Sequence unpacking [[Unpacking sequences and iterables]] and sequence patterns[[Pattern Matching with Sequences]];
4. Reading from slices and writing to slices, [[Slicing]];
6. Specialized sequence types, like arrays and queues.
